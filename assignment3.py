# Assignment 3
# This file provides functions to create quantum circuits that generate entanglement.
# Learners are expected to implement the logic for the `ghz_circuit` function within
# the specified section of the function.
#
# Instructions:
# - Complete the `ghz_circuit` function as described in its docstring.
# - Do not modify code outside the indicated editable section.
# - You are only allowed to to use the Hadamard gate and the 2 qubit CNOT gate.
#
# Testing:
# - To verify your implementation, run the provided test file:
#   test_assignment3.py, using the command:
#   python -m unittest test_assignment3.py
